# Age Estimation by Regression

The FG-NET Aging Dataset is used in this assignment. The dataset contains AAM features from 1002 face images, 500 of which are set aside for training and 502 for testing. AAM features have 201 dimensions. Images of 82 people of various ethnicities are included in the dataset. Each individual has approximately 12 photos with varying lighting, poses, and expressions. The dataset is labelled and ordered chronologically based on the people's ages, which range from 0 to 69.
