# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING BOW

In image classification, the term "bag of visual words" (BOVW) is frequently used. Its concept is based on information retrieval and NLP's bag of words (BOW). A document is thought of as a collection of words (BOW). We have the same concept in bag of visual words (BOVW), but instead of words, we use image features as "words." Image features are distinctive patterns found in images.
